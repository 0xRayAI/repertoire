## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `hydrateWritableSignals` always copies the factory seed to `.xray/state/repertoire/curated_signals.json`, including when cwd is this organ repo. Dogfooding no longer mutates `data/curated_signals.json`.
- `CuratedSignalsManager.save` refuses the tarball seed path (`isFactorySeedFile`).
